## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
## Our aim in this experiment is to write a pair of functions, namely, 
## "makeCacheMatrix" and "cacheSolve" that cache the inverse of a matrix

## Write a short comment describing this function
## makeCacheMatrix is a function which creates a special "matrix" object that can 
## cache its inverse for the input (which is an invertible square matrix)

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinv <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getinv <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get, setinv = setinv, getinv = getinv)
}
